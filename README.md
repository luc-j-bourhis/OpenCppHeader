# Open Cpp Header

This is a plugin for Sublime Text 3. It makes it possible to quickly jump from a line featuring

    #include "..."
or

    #include <...>
in C or C++ code to the corresponding header file. The plugin is just a little convenience bridge to the command available as "Goto Anything ..." in the "Goto" menu. The search for the header is therefore blazingly fast.
